2.	User Data Sent Off the User's Device by Libraries or SDKs: Our app employs certain third-party libraries and SDKs for enhanced functionality. While we prioritize user data privacy, it's important to note that some of these tools might collect data.

Users can rest assured that their privacy remains a top priority.

4.	User Data Collected or Transferred Through a Webview: Our app does not collect or transfer user data through webviews.
